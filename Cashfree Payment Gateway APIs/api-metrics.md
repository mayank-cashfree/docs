The API metrics is a new feature on the merchant dashboard under the developer section. API metrics provide you with more visibility in terms of metrics and the health of your APIs. This section provides you in-depth data on metrics such as:

- Error Counts
- Latency 
- API Usage
- Error Percentage

Select the time range and the request type. The API metrics will be generated based on the criteria you have filtered. 

## Error Counts

The error count is the count of the different errors that are received during the API calls. Hover your mouse over the error counts region to view the error message. You can also download the error counts data.
