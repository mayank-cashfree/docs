### Why use Server SDKs?

At Cashfree Payments, we're committed to streamlining backend integrations for merchants using our robust Server SDKs. Here's why opting for Server SDKs is a game-changer:

1. **Simplified Backend Calls:** Leverage language-specific SDKs to make backend API calls effortlessly. SDKs encapsulate API complexities, allowing smooth integration into server-side applications.
2. **Increased Efficiency:** Directly utilize SDK functions/methods tailored for specific programming languages (Go, Python, Java, etc.), saving development time and improving code readability within your server environment.
3. **Automated Updates:** Our SDKs are automatically updated in sync with API modifications, ensuring alignment with the latest features and enhancements.

### Choose your language specific SDK
