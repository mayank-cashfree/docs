Cashfree APIs and an easy to use dashboard allow you as a merchant to cater to the banking needs of your customers by issuing them different payment instruments. Customers here are referred to as your business customers.

In this section, we will understand how to create, edit, view or delete customers on the Cashfree Payments platform.

# Add Customers

To create payment instruments for your customers you need to first add the customer by specifying their details.

To add a new customer, 

- Navigate to the Customers tab using the left-hand navigation.
- Click **Add Customer** on the top right of the dashboard.
- Enter the required details along with a unique identifier for the customer.

Note: The unique identifier will be subsequently used to perform operations for this customer like issuing payment instruments.

## Adding a customer using APIs

In addition to the Cashfree dashboard, you can also opt to integrate with our RESTful APIs and automate your business needs. This is more suited for a higher scale and requires development effort at your end.

Explore our [API reference](ref:customers) to know more about the Customer APIs.
