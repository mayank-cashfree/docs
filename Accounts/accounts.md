Why Cashfree Payments Accounts?

Cashfree Payments BaaS platform **Accounts** allows you to create payment instruments for your customers and facilitate different financial and non-financial operations like fund transfer, fetch balance, and others.

We have done complex integrations with leading banks so that you don't have to invest in bank integration, compliances and other operational processes. When you use the Accounts API, Cashfree interacts with our partner banks servers and create a new account within minutes.

Get notified in real-time on all the activities related to accounts creation, money transfer and other day-to-day operations.

Contact [care@cashfree.com](mailto:care@cashfree.com) to get this product activated for your account.

Example: 

- Let us say that you own anÂ HRMS platform, and you want to increase engagement by providing more tailored banking services. You decide to allow corporates to open bank accounts for their employees with almost no paperwork. You can achieve this using our APIs or by using our intuitive and powerful product dashboard.

- For an e-commerce platform, you can reward your customers with loyalty points. To do this, you decide to issue a prepaid card with your brand name on it, and as soon as customers spend using the card, you will post the cash-back on the card. This will allow you to analyse their spending behaviours and offer more tailored products, strengthening retention and engagement.

For either of the use cases, if you decide to do it yourself, it could take you a lot more effort and time to manage multiple banking integrations or flows. Cashfree's Accounts makes it easy and simple to manage multiple payment instrument-related activities seamlessly.

## Payment Instruments

Cashfree Payments brings to you a curated banking experience that enables you to create payment instruments for your customers and perform subsequent financial and non-financial operations on these instruments. 

Payment instruments are different modes through which a user can either disburse or collect payments. Either banks or non-banking financial entities issue payment instruments.

Currently, we support the opening of current accounts only. 

Examples of Payment Instruments:

- Accounts - Current/Savings/Virtual
- Cards - Credit Cards/Prepaid Cards
- Wallets
- UPI
