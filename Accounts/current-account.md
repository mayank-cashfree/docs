Cashfree Payments new product Accounts enables you to quickly integrate banking services from leading banks into your product via APIs. Enable your users to open accounts, link accounts, accept deposits, make payouts, check balance, earn interest, and more.

Why Cashfree Payments Accounts?

Cashfree Payments BaaS platform **Accounts** allows you to create payment instruments for your customers and facilitate different financial and non-financial operations like fund transfer, fetch balance, and others.

We have done complex integrations with leading banks so that you don't have to invest in bank integration, compliances and other operational processes. When you use the Accounts API, Cashfree interacts with our partner banks servers and create a new account within minutes.

Get notified in real-time on all the activities related to accounts creation, money transfer and other day-to-day operations.

Contact [care@cashfree.com](mailto:care@cashfree.com) to get this product activated for your account.

Example: 

- Let us say that you own anÂ HRMS platform, and you want to increase engagement by providing more tailored banking services. You decide to allow corporates to open bank accounts for their employees with almost no paperwork. You can achieve this using our APIs or by using our intuitive and powerful product dashboard.

- For an e-commerce platform, you can reward your customers with loyalty points. To do this, you decide to issue a prepaid card with your brand name on it, and as soon as customers spend using the card, you will post the cash-back on the card. This will allow you to analyse their spending behaviours and offer more tailored products, strengthening retention and engagement.

For either of the use cases, if you decide to do it yourself, it could take you a lot more effort and time to manage multiple banking integrations or flows. Cashfree's Accounts makes it easy and simple to manage multiple payment instrument related activities seamlessly.

# Current Account

Cashfree Payments enables you to seamlessly open current accounts for your customers and once the account is created and linked to our BaaS solution Accounts, our APIs will help your customers to make payments, check their balances and fetch their bank statements on your platform.

Cashfree Payments provides an admin dashboard where you can explore features of our banking as a service suite, aggregate customer and instrument details and also make informed decisions based on our reports. The dashboard can also be used to initiate account opening requests. All the features on the dashboard are also offered through our APIs. We recommend using our APIs for a faster creation and enablement of current account for multiple customers at one go.

To open a current account with Cashfree Payments,

1. Add customer details. You can do this using the product dashboard or the API. You can also edit customer details when required.
2. Create a payment instrument for the customer. In this case, the payment instrument would be a current account for a customer.
3. Customers can open a new current account or add an existing current account with our partner banks. For new current account creation, you must complete an offline KYC procedure. For adding an existing current account with our partner bank no additional KYC process is required.
4. After the account is opened, you can activate connected banking to enable payouts, statement and balance checks and other features for the customer on your platform using our APIs.

# API Host

Cashfree Payments platform provides a sandbox environment where you can explore the capabilities of our API Banking suite. We recommend you do all developmental activities and testing in the sandbox environment. All activity in the Production environment will be billed. Once you have tested in the sandbox and are ready to deploy, we will complete your KYC process and enable the production environment for you to go live.

# On-Boarding & KYC Verification Process

The partner bank is notified after you add and submit the details of the customer for opening the current account. The bank begins the onboarding process for the customer.

The bank first reaches out to the customer, post which their offline KYC process is initiated where a field executive does an on-site verification, as mandated by the RBI. The customer must submit a set of documents required for KYC verification as requested by the bank. The checklist for each partner bank is provided at the end of the page.

Please note for ICICI Bank, the onboarding process will only begin once customer completes OTP on the unique ICICI link we provide to you as an API response (Refer to the block diagram below for better understanding.)

The onboarding and KYC flow for ICICI current account customers is shown below:
